# Corona Tracker

Welcome to the COVID-19 Tracker web application! Here you can see realtime updates on important statistics such as confirmed case number, deaths, and recoveries. The data is both numerically displayed, but also visually with charts. You are able to see both data on a global scale, and also from an individual country's perspective.
